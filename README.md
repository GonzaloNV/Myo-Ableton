Myo-Ableton
===========

Ok, so this is how it works.

You need to copy the Myo-Basic folder into the User Remote Scripts folder. You can find it by ctrl+right clicking the Ableton Application Icon > Show Package Contents, then Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/. It is a hidden folder, so you need to turn that on. Here is a way : http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/

You also need to add the script to Myo Connect using the application manager.

Then just run Live, and on the MIDI preferences menu, select Myo-Basic, and activate myo's "track" and "remote".

Now you are ready to go. By loading any rack and selecting it (the little blue hand) you´ll be taking control of it.

It takes a little getting used to, but then you´ll be modulating anything with a couple very cool movements
